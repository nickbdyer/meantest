#MEAN Stack Tutorial

Following the tutorial presented on
[scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/setting-up-a-mean-stack-single-page-application).

In advance of a personal project with some friends in a MEAN stack, we each
opted to follow various tutorials in an effort to educate ourselves on the
basic setup procedure. 

Documentation is still generally scarce for MEAN stack development, it seems
you either find one of the four components is missing from the tutorial. And if
all four are present, TDD is never mentioned. 

This and another repo were used as a basis for development of our [Sports
Ladder](https://github.com/ralake/sports_ladder).
